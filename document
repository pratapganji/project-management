Hi LSE Global Support Team,

We are currently migrating the SB User Consumption application to OpenShift (OCP) and, as part of this activity, we need to download a required JDBC API JAR from the Artifactory repository to include it in our Dockerfile.

However, we are facing a permission/access issue while attempting to download the JAR file from the below Artifactory URL from docker file:
https://www.artifactrepository.citigroup.net/artifactory/maven-icg-enterprise-local/com/citi/167969/olympus/api/olympus-jdbc-driver/2.2.0.TH/olympus-jdbc-driver-2.2.0.TH.jar

Due to this access restriction, we are unable to proceed with the Openshift migration. Kindly help us by:

1. Granting the required permissions to download this artifact thorugh docker file using curl OR
2. Suggesting the correct repository/path or alternate approach to obtain this JAR

This is required on priority, as it is blocking our migration activity.
Please let us know if any additional details are required from our side.
