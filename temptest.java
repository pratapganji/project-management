Subject: RE: HTTPS via Apigee for CRM Olympus API â€“ Region confirmation

Hi Sachin / Team,

The 503 Service Unavailable error is expected at the moment since the UAT VIP activation is pending under Change Request CHG0000701354.
The approved implementation window is:
ðŸ•“ Start: Oct 9, 2025 â€“ 5:00 PM EDT
ðŸ•“ End: Oct 10, 2025 â€“ 4:50 PM EDT

Weâ€™ll proceed with the VIP activation during that timeframe and revalidate the Apigee endpoint afterward.
Iâ€™ll share an update once the service is available post-implementation.

Thanks & Regards,
[Your Full Name]
CRM-Olympus Team
