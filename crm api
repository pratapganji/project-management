CRM (HTTP) -> VIP - 2 (local COB/Actual prod) -> WIP

crm.xyz.net

APIGEE -> WIP of PROD / WIP of COB


CAS system - WIP is an endpoint (URI), VIP is an endpoint (URI)

WIP of prod - > VIP of VM - PROD server
WIP of COB - > VIP of VM - COB server


Existing:
APIGEE -> WIP of prod (http) -> VIP of prod (http) -> VM server code
       -> WIP of COB (http) -> VIP of cob (http) -> VM server code
	   
Needs to be done:
APIGEE -> WIP of prod (https) -> VIP of prod (https) -> VM server code (context path change)

How do we do:
Exitsing code -> https changes (feature branch) -> release branch -> commit -> build number -> Udeploy - existing DEV VM
																									   - existing UAT VM
																									   - NEW VM - PROD
