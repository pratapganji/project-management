Update: Job is no longer stuck at metadata. Impala query, metadata fetch, CSV generation, and upload step all executed successfully. Current failure is at Oracle insert with ORA-12899 — TABLE_PHYSICAL_NAME value exceeds column length (53 > 50). Planning to trim value in code or align DB column length.
