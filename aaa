Subject: RE: Impala connectivity for sb user consumption – UAT

Hi Sajay / Team,

We retried multiple times and the issue is consistent (not intermittent).

SSL and truststore configuration is working correctly now. The application successfully reaches the Olympus gRPC endpoint using olympus-jdbc-driver-2.1.6.jar.

However, the connection is failing during authentication with the following error:

Authentication failure on CitiFed.
Username or FID/password (SSO) is incorrect.

This occurs after successful SSL handshake and server connection, indicating an authentication/authorization issue for the FID being used.

Could you please help verify:
	•	Whether the FID sb_olympus_fid_u is enabled for Olympus JDBC access in UAT
	•	Whether the password/SSO configured for this FID is valid
	•	Whether this FID is authorized for Starburst/Impala access via the gRPC endpoint

Please let us know if any additional mapping or entitlement is required on the API side.

Thanks,
Pratap
