Subject: UAT Testing Request – CRM Olympus Autosys Jobs

Hi Mangesh,

As discussed, we have deployed new Autosys jobs for the CRM Olympus application in the UAT environment.

I’ve created a Jira sub-task and assigned it to you for tracking:
Jira: https://cedt-icg-jira.nam.nsroot.net/jira/browse/C1679695-128406

Below are the Autosys job details deployed in UAT (QA5):

- 167969_OM_CRM_OLYMPUS_API_HTTPS_SERVER1_STOP  
- 167969_OM_CRM_OLYMPUS_API_HTTPS_SERVER1_START  
- 167969_OM_CRM_OLYMPUS_API_HTTPS_SERVER2_STOP

- 167969_OM_CRM_OLYMPUS_API_HTTPS_SERVER3_STOP

Requesting you to please perform UAT testing for the above jobs.  
If possible, we are aiming to complete testing within the next 2 days or by this weekend, so that we can plan for production deployment next week.

Please let me know if you need any additional details or support during testing.  
CC’ing Parmeshwar and Dnyaneshwar for visibility.

Thanks in advance for your support.

Best regards,  
Pratap
