We are deploying the CRM Olympus HTTPS Autosys jobs via OneRec ORAAS first because direct deployment through CRM Autosys was resulting in exit code 13 due to enterprise job launcher restrictions.

ORAAS and CRM Autosys run on the same DA5, QA5, and PA5 instances. However, the job metadata must be registered in ORAAS tables (OM_JOB_MASTER_INSTANCE and OM_JOB_PROPERTIES) to comply with governance and job launcher standards.

Once ORAAS registration is completed, we deploy the JIL through CRM Autosys repository, which invokes the enterprise job launcher instead of executing shell commands directly.

This approach aligns with platform security guidelines and avoids permission-related execution failures.

🔹 CRM Olympus HTTPS – Autosys Jobs Deployment Update

We are deploying the CRM Olympus HTTPS Autosys jobs using a controlled two-step approach.

First, the job metadata is registered in OneRec ORAAS because direct deployment through CRM Autosys was failing with exit code 13 due to enterprise job launcher restrictions. Although ORAAS and CRM Autosys run on the same DA5, QA5, and PA5 instances, governance standards require job definitions to be registered in the ORAAS tables (OM_JOB_MASTER_INSTANCE and OM_JOB_PROPERTIES).

Once ORAAS registration is completed, we deploy the corresponding JIL files through the CRM Autosys repository. The JIL invokes the enterprise job launcher, ensuring secure and compliant execution.

🔹 Production Safety Clarification

Currently, production is still running on the existing HTTP CRM target server URL.

The HTTPS changes were deployed using a new UDeploy component and new pipeline, completely isolated from the current production setup.

The Apigee target server URL has not been switched to HTTPS yet. Therefore:
	•	No impact to existing production traffic
	•	No routing changes
	•	No RF or rollback impact
	•	No effect on current HTTP version

This deployment only prepares the HTTPS Autosys jobs and keeps the existing PROD flow untouched.

🔹 Closing Statement

This approach aligns with platform security and governance standards, resolves permission-related execution failures, and ensures zero impact to the current production environment.

We are deploying the CRM Olympus HTTPS Autosys JIL files (START and STOP jobs) through the CRM Autosys repository. These jobs invoke the enterprise olympus_jobLauncher.ksh script and follow standard scheduling, logging, and retry configurations. DA5 and QA5 validation has been completed successfully. This deployment only introduces HTTPS job configuration and does not impact the current HTTP production setup.
