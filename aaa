Subject: RE: gfolybkb fid Vulnerability Remediation Plan

Hi Rajat / Team,

As part of the Feb 16 PROD deployment, the reported vulnerable folders (CRM-Olympus.50, .56, .57, .61, .70, .83) were removed through the standard deployment process.

I have reviewed the vulnerabilities listed in the attached Excel sheet, and all reported items correspond to these same folders that were deleted on Feb 16.

The screenshots shared earlier were taken on the deployment date (Feb 16) showing the folders before and after removal. Currently, I do not have PROD access, so I am referring to those deployment screenshots.

I will coordinate with the team having access to re-validate in PROD and reconfirm that these folders are no longer present.

Please let me know if any additional action is required from my side.

Thanks & Regards,
Pratap
