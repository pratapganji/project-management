We are deploying the CRM Olympus HTTPS Autosys jobs via OneRec ORAAS first because direct deployment through CRM Autosys was resulting in exit code 13 due to enterprise job launcher restrictions.

ORAAS and CRM Autosys run on the same DA5, QA5, and PA5 instances. However, the job metadata must be registered in ORAAS tables (OM_JOB_MASTER_INSTANCE and OM_JOB_PROPERTIES) to comply with governance and job launcher standards.

Once ORAAS registration is completed, we deploy the JIL through CRM Autosys repository, which invokes the enterprise job launcher instead of executing shell commands directly.

This approach aligns with platform security guidelines and avoids permission-related execution failures.
