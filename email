Subject: Assistance Required: UDeploy Plugin Error – Missing Java Directory on Agent

Hi SA Team,

We are facing a UDeploy deployment failure due to a plugin error for the below application:

Application: CRM Olympus API
GitHub Repository: https://github.com/CitiInternal/160970.crm-olympus.crm-olympus-api/commits/release/crm-olympus-api/￼
UDeploy Log: https://releasedeployment3.ti.citigroup.net:8443/#applicationProcessRequest/19a54baa-2501-a30a-1620-1f6325d82766/log￼

Error from logs:

It seems that the Java directory or symlink under /opt/jre/11.0_25164/bin/java is missing or not properly configured on the agent node.

Could you please check the affected agent and verify that the correct Java path is installed and accessible?
This is blocking our deployment for the CRM Olympus API.

Thank you for your support.

Best regards,
Pratap Ganji
