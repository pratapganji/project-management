Enhance logging, error handling, and null checks across StartBustService, NuraFlowController, and StructuredLogUtil. Every request and response must include globalTransactionId, record count, and precise success or failure details. Implement additional catch blocks, execution time logs, and null-safe conditions. Ensure StructuredLogUtil.checkFinalAuditData handles empty error messages gracefully, providing complete traceability and consistent audit logs in all scenarios.
