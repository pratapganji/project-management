Target server URL vs VIP vs WIP
	•	Each backend server (dev/qa/uat/prod) has its own target server URL (hostnames differ per node).
	•	In PROD, there are two clusters: PROD and COB (COB = Continuity Of Business). Example: 3 PROD nodes + 3 COB nodes ⇒ 6 target URLs.
	•	Create a VIP (Virtual IP) over the 3 PROD nodes, and another VIP over the 3 COB nodes. VIPs do load balancing (e.g., round-robin) across their 3 servers.
	•	Create a WIP (Wide IP) on top of the two VIPs. Flow becomes: WIP → (VIP-PROD or VIP-COB) → one of 3 servers. This distributes traffic across all 6 servers.
	•	Apigee sits in front: Consumer → Apigee (authn/authz) → WIP → VIPs → servers.
	•	Current pain
	•	Today, target server URLs are HTTP, so WIP and VIP are HTTP, while Apigee is HTTPS.
	•	Because the underlying hop is HTTP, Apigee keeps generating alerts. We need to flip the whole chain under Apigee to HTTPS: target servers → VIPs → WIP → (then Apigee stays HTTPS).
	•	Why not a single “big bang” change in PROD
	•	During Green Zone (Sat evening → Sun; ~16–24h) you could:
	1.	change target URLs to HTTPS, 2) update VIPs, 3) update WIP, 4) update Apigee.
	•	But doing all live, in sequence, is risky and hard to roll back (no quick revert if you mutate the only live chain).
	•	Preferred approach (safer)
	•	Make a replica deployment in PROD (a second API deployment with a new name, no consumers initially).
	•	Build new HTTPS chain for it end-to-end: target URLs (HTTPS) → VIPs (HTTPS) → WIP (HTTPS) and wire that under a new Apigee proxy (or same proxy with new target, but isolated).
	•	Test in DEV/UAT with users, then switch Apigee routing in PROD from old WIP to new WIP.
	•	Rollback is simple: switch Apigee back to old WIP if something breaks.
	•	ECS would solve HTTPS more cleanly, but capacity isn’t available yet. Until ECS arrives, proceed with the VM-based replica.
	•	Testing
	•	There are no Postman collections (protobuf). Use the in-house client code (“standalone client”) to hit endpoints and validate end-to-end (request → Kafka).
	•	Sachin will provide the client and prior APIM→Apigee migration notes (useful context).
	•	Ownership & tools
	•	VIP/WIP are managed in the CAS portal (Rupesh/APIs team can help).
	•	Timeline target: UAT by early Nov, PROD later via switch-over.
	•	Immediate asks: coordinate with Kumar (ECS capacity), Shan & networking team for VIP/WIP, and Rohit for testing; Aparna for subscription follow-up.
Exact plan you can execute

1) DEV / UAT (this week)
	1.	Update target server URLs to HTTPS on the VMs.
	2.	In CAS portal: create/update VIPs (HTTPS) for DEV/UAT clusters.
	3.	In CAS portal: create/update WIP (HTTPS) that fronts both VIPs.
	4.	Update Apigee target(s) to point to the new WIP (HTTPS).
	5.	Use the standalone protobuf client (from Sachin) to validate:
	•	2xx responses,
	•	records flow to Kafka,
	•	no TLS errors.
	6.	Have UAT consumers perform sample hits and confirm end-to-end.

2) PROD (replica approach — safer)
	1.	Create a replica API deployment (new name; no consumers yet).
	2.	Configure new HTTPS target server URLs for that replica.
	3.	In CAS portal: create new VIP-PROD(HTTPS) and new VIP-COB(HTTPS); then a new WIP(HTTPS) over those VIPs.
	4.	Point the replica Apigee proxy (or a second revision) to the new WIP(HTTPS).
	5.	Validate with the standalone client against UAT-like data (non-destructive checks).
	6.	Green Zone cutover: flip Apigee routing from old WIP → new WIP.
	7.	Monitor errors, latency, Kafka ingestion, and consumer KPIs.
	8.	Rollback plan: if issues, immediately switch Apigee back to old WIP.

3) Deliverables & owners
	•	CAS portal configs (VIPs/WIP; dev/uat/prod/COB) — Rupesh / NetOps with you.
	•	Apigee updates and revisions — API team (you + Sachin).
	•	Standalone client & test script — Sachin to share.
	•	Runbook: step-by-step cutover + rollback — you draft; review with lead.
	•	Status emails (to Rohit, Aparna) — you to send.

Risk & mitigation
	•	Risk: Mixed HTTP/HTTPS hop causes alerts or TLS handshake failures.
Mitigation: Convert bottom-up (targets → VIPs → WIP), test before Apigee switch.
	•	Risk: No quick rollback after mutating live chain.
Mitigation: Replica chain + Apigee pointer switch as reversible cutover.
	•	Risk: Client incompatibility (protobuf shape).
Mitigation: Validate with standalone client and sample data in UAT first.

What to ask / confirm now
	•	Access to CAS portal and who approves VIP/WIP changes.
	•	Confirmation of server certificates on each VM (CN/SAN matches VIP/WIP FQDNs).
	•	Cipher suites/TLS version policies that Apigee expects (avoid handshake issues).
	•	Green Zone exact window and comms plan for stakeholders.
	•	Receipt of standalone client from Sachin.
